# hashcode_22_qualifying
Together with @Daniel and @Ignacio we participated in the Google Hashcode challenge from 2022. 
We got 4 hours to create an algorithm that solves an assignment problem of tasks in jobs to contributors 
including  a variety of constraints that can be found on the Google Hashcode website.
